🎬 TikTok Coin Recharge Simulator (UI Demo)

I built a TikTok-style Coin Recharge Simulator — a local demo that mimics the real TikTok coin-buying page for testing and presentation.

🪙 What it does
• Replicates the TikTok coin purchase flow: username entry, coin bundles, checkout, and confirmation.
• Simulates Order Summary → Processing → Payment Completed modals — all UI-only.
• Stores recent transactions locally in your browser (localStorage).
• Fully PWA-installable — add to Home Screen and run like an app.
• No network calls, no real payments — everything is local.
it work as an app for phone and pc 
⚠️ Disclaimer: UI demo only. It does not connect to TikTok or process real payments.
